# vimrc
just my vim config!

Rename to `.vimrc` if using Linux and put it in your home directory (or config directory like `.config` if you use one).
If in windows, put it in `C:/Users/<You>` (`$HOME`) with the same filename and it should work.

Open it in vim and type `:PluginInstall` in command mode after installing [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
